How It Works[ENTER]
1. Four randomly selected guilds face off against one another.[ENTER]
2. When all the monsters in a zone have been defeated, the guild[ENTER]
which has defeated the most monsters conquers the zone. If guilds are[ENTER]
tied, the zone belongs to the guild which last killed a monster.[ENTER]
3. Once a zone is conquered by a guild, a portal appears, and[ENTER]
monsters spawn to defend the conquered zone.[ENTER]
4. Participating guilds can return to the Guild Battle Zone until the[ENTER]
battle is over.[ENTER]
5. If you wish to respawn at your current location, you need a Guild[ENTER]
Respawn. These can be purchased from the Guild Merchant at the Guild[ENTER]
Outpost.[ENTER]
6. In order to be able to teleport to another zone during the Guild[ENTER]
Battle, the zone must belong to your guild and you require a Guild[ENTER]
Portal Ticket. These can also be purchased from the Guild Merchant at[ENTER]
the Guild Outpost.[ENTER]
7. If you resurrect in the village, you can return to the battle via[ENTER]
the Guild Battle menu.[ENTER]
[ENTER]
Rewards[ENTER]
1. There are individual rewards (awarded for player kills) as well as[ENTER]
guild rewards (awarded for the number of conquered zones).[ENTER]
2. Rewards are awarded for each zone. The colour of the zone[ENTER]
indicates which guild is currently in possession. The Victor's Chest[ENTER]
you receive depends on the location of the conquered zone.[ENTER]
3. You can collect rewards from the Guild Battle menu.[ENTER]
4. Rewards can be collected until 30 minutes before the next Guild[ENTER]
Battle.[ENTER]
5. In order to open the Victor's Chest, you'll need a Victor's Key.[ENTER]
These keys can be earned by defeating monsters in Guild Battles.[ENTER]
6. Rewards are awarded after the Guild Battle according to the number[ENTER]
of conquered zones and player kills.[ENTER]
7. The individual rewards are useful buffs:[ENTER]
10 kills: +5% defence[ENTER]
20 kills: +5% EXP bonus[ENTER]
30 kills: +5% strength against monsters[ENTER]
40 kills: +5% chance of critical hits[ENTER]
The value increases every 10 kills, up to a 10% bonus for each buff[ENTER]
when you reach 120 kills.[ENTER]
8. The number of guild rewards equals the number of zones conquered[ENTER]
multiplied by the number of guilds who fought for control of the[ENTER]
zone. That means you can receive up to 4 rewards if all 4 guilds[ENTER]
tried to conquer the zone.[ENTER]
The quality of reward depends on the last zone conquered.[ENTER]
