# README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Quick summary
* Version
* [Learn Markdown](https://bitbucket.org/tutorials/markdowndemo)

### How do I get set up? ###

* Summary of set up
-Extract Extern.rar in ".\Srcs\"
-Open ".\Srcs\Extern\cryptopp\cryptlib.sln" and compile it
-Open ".\Srcs\Client\Metin2Client.sln" and compile it

@\Srcs\Extern\cryptopp is compiler-version based and should recompile with MT target option
>maybe without /GL and /LTCG should be fine too

* Configuration
@#PYTHON2 2.7
>in ".\Srcs\Extern\include\Python27"

@#GRANNY2 (granny2.11 by default)
>easy switch in ".\Srcs\Extern\include\granny.h" amongst granny2.4, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 2.11

#@@Globally
@warme601: use release as advanced distribute with syserr.txt and so on
@warme666: those features requires the same feature server-sidely otherwise you'll get random issues. (packets not correctly handled)
@warme667: on ScriptLib/StdAfx.h; AT has been unset before loading python include
@warme668: trivial errors will be treated as mere warnings (sys_err -> sys_log) (TraceError -> Tracenf)
@warme669: on UserInterface/PythonNetworkStreamPhaseGame.cpp; the packet receive will be increased from 4 to 8 (totally removing the limit will cause packet instability)
@warme670: on PythonApplication.cpp; the text in the error message was wrong
@warme671: on ActorInstanceMotion.cpp; commented out the useless debug code that occludes the view


#@@Client
@warme001: AIL_startup responsible to load *.asi *.flt *.m3d *.mix
@warme002: comments to be cleaned if necessary
@warme003: messages now contain more useful information


@fixme001: on UserInterface/Packet.h; for do_view_equip (WEAR_MAX_NUM: server 32, client 11) now equal (32 both sides)
@fixme002: on EterLib/GrpImageTexture.cpp, GrpImage.cpp; to show the name of the failed mapped .dds load
@fixme003: on PRTerrainLib/TextureSet.cpp; a new texture was added where the last was put
@fixme004: on PRTerrainLib/TextureSet.cpp; a new textureset index was -1 instead of 0
@fixme005: on EterLib/SkyBox.cpp; the bottom pic was not shown
@fixme006: on UserInterface/PythonNetworkStreamModule.cpp, PythonNetworkStreamPhaseGame.cpp; "SEQUENCE mismatch 0xaf != 0x64 header 254" fix
			This happens due to a bug on the TODO_RECV_SYMBOL phase when calling the __SendSymbolCRCList.
			That function will connect via MarkServer_Login and iterate m_kVec_dwGuildID to send sub-"HEADER_CG_SYMBOL_CRC" packets.
			If m_kVec_dwGuildID is 0, the server will never receive packets after logged in the MarkServer, and the connection won't be closed.
			When a connection is established, a ping_event will be triggered every 60 seconds.
			When the time will come, a ping packet will be send to the client, and the client will reply back with a pong one.
			In this case, the secondary marklogin connection would be asynchronous, and the packet sequence for the pong mismatched too.
			After the sequence error occurs, the marklogin connection will be finally closed.

			In few words, everytime someone logs in the server (after character selection),
			the syserr will get once the mismatch error after 60 seconds.
			The fix is to not establish a marklogin connection for TODO_RECV_SYMBOL if the m_kVec_dwGuildID is 0.
@fixme008: on EterLib/IME.cpp; Ctrl+V crash when pasting images&co (no checks whether the handle was NULL or not)
@fixme009: on UserInterface/PythonPlayerModule.cpp; player.GetItemLink wasn't considering 6-7 bonuses enough
			they could have been seen as 1-5 bonuses if the item didn't have 1-5 bonuses
@fixme010: on UserInterface/PythonCharacterManager.cpp; ymir forgot .m_dwVID in the format argument (c_rkCreateData -> c_rkCreateData.m_dwVID)
@fixme011: on EterLib/IME.cpp; non-printing/control characters were printed in the (chat) input (the ones you get when you press Ctrl+<key> in game)
@fixme012: on EterLib/TextTag.cpp; on arabic locales, the [HyperText code] (alias Prism code) could be edited pressing <Backspace>
@fixme013: on UserInterface/PythonPlayerModule.cpp; player.IsValuableItem was selecting a wrong item.cell
@fixme014: on UserInterface/PythonPlayerInput.cpp; if you (mouse) click a monster without having arrows, the automatic attack will go in loop (clicking on ground again will fix, but moving with WASD will be bad)
@fixme015: on GameLib/MapOutdoorLoad.cpp; regen.txt was loaded from launcher even though it's used only by the WorldEditor
@fixme016: on UserInterface/PythonShop.cpp; ShopEx data weren't cleared if normal shops were open
@fixme018: on EterLib/GrpDevice.cpp; on computers where 800x600 resolution has been removed, it would trigger "CREATE_NO_APPROPRIATE_DEVICE"
@fixme020: on ScriptLib/Resource.cpp; .png textures weren't listed
@fixme021: on GameLib/RaceManager.cpp; new npclist.txt autodetects season shape.msm automatically
@fixme022: on UserInterface/PythonItem.cpp; GetCloseItem distance calculation failed during float conversion (faraway items got distance 2 making them unpickable)
@fixme024: on UserInterface/Packet.h; TChannelStatus will always return the status offline any channel with ports higher than 32767.
@fixme025: on UserInterface/InstanceBase.h, InstanceBaseEffect.cpp; if you were to receive many damage packets, the damage queue will keep showing damange texts even after a while
@fixme026: on GameLib/RaceMotionDataEvent.h; backslashes were giving a wrong crc32 for the registered effects
@fixme027: on EffectLib/EffectMesh.cpp, EffectMeshInstance.cpp; custom mde files with no index vertex would trigger a crash
@fixme028: on EterPythonLib/PythonWindowManagerModule.cpp; wnd.TextSetFontColor had a signed/unsigned limit issue
@fixme029: on UserInterface/PythonApplication.cpp, EterGrnLib/ModelInstanceUpdate.cpp; black screen fix - effectmanager wasn't delecting expired effects, and granny wasn't updating the models
@fixme030: on EffectLib/EffectManager.cpp, GameLib/ActorInstance.cpp, GameLib/ActorInstanceAttach.cpp, GameLib/Area.cpp; the calculated crc32 will mismatch in case of uppercase letters
@fixme031: on UserInterface/PythonApplication.cpp; the dropshadow style in win10 and the bigger taskbar were causing boring issues
@fixme032: on UserInterface/PythonApplicationProcedure.cpp; ALT+key was triggering a windows system sound
@fixme033: on GameLib/ActorInstanceSync.cpp; there was a desync when a mental strong body was being attacked without moving (server-side respawn still glitched)
@fixme034: on UserInterface/NetworkActorManager.cpp; stones weren't properly cleared as actors
@fixme035: on EterPack.cpp; memory leak in eterpack::get for panama and hybrid type
@fixme036: on PythonTextTail.cpp; level position wrongly positioned
@fixme037: on PythonPlayerInputMouse.cpp; little glitch when picking items with the horse (infinite rotation)
@fixme038: on mileslib/SoundManager.cpp; stopped sounds were later played back unsuccessfully
@fixme039: on EterLib/StateManager.cpp; the anisotropic texture filtering was applied only once at startup, but not after lostdevice/recoverydevice


#@@Tools
#@/DumpProto
@fixme201: on ItemCSVReader.cpp; race splitted with | instead of ,


#@/Metin2PackMaker
@fixme301: on Main.cpp; The path ignored is always "d:/ymir work/sound/" instead of the chosen one
@fixme302: on Main.cpp; The directory ignored is always "CVS" instead of the chosen one


#@/Metin2MsaMaker
@fixme401: on Metin2MSAMaker.cpp; the accumulation wasn't calculated at all on model versions above 2.4


#@/General
@fixme501: on UserInterface/Packet.h; mob race word to dword
@fixme502: on UserInterface/Packet.h; character part word to dword


* Other guidelines
@\Srcs\Client\EterBase\Filename.h pseudo-fix to "successfully" compile
>needs rewriting (or simply fixing)

@\Srcs\Client\ScriptLib\PythonUtils.cpp with pseudo-long fix
#define PyLong_AsLong PyLong_AsLongLong
#define PyLong_AsUnsignedLong PyLong_AsUnsignedLongLong
>just this so it'll be 8 bytes instead of 4 for tuples
>an another way is just to change every color function with Py_xUnsigned instead of its Signed
